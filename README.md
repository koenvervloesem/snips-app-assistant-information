**Important information: Following the acquisition of Snips by Sonos, the Snips Console is not available anymore after January 31 2020. As such, I have archived this Snips app, I have exported all data of the English version of this app from the Snips Console and made these available in the directory [console](https://github.com/koenvervloesem/snips-app-assistant-information/tree/master/console) with the same MIT license as the rest of this project.**

With this [Snips](https://snips.ai/) app, you can ask some information about your Snips assistant, like its name, ID, the platform it is running on, the Snips version, the latest available Snips version, whether it's running the latest Snips version, its hostname and IP address, its uptime, the installed apps and the number of intents it understands. 

## Installation

The easiest way to install this app is by adding the corresponding Snips app to your assistant in the [Snips Console](https://console.snips.ai):
